# Hello-world

My name is Solomon Buaku Pobee from Accra, Ghana. I am in a family of eight including my parents. I love playing soccer games and enjoy reading a lot. 
I really enjoy baking with my mum because it's fun when I am in the kitchen with my mum, one other reason for helping in the kitchen to bake is to have the opportunity to taste the baked cake.
